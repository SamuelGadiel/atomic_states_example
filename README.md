# Atomic States using RxNotifier
This is a simple proof of concept to see how to integrate an Atomic State Pattern with Flutter, using RxNotifier as a helper

## Packages Used
There are only two packages in the pubspec folder, being

- [rx_notifier](https://pub.dev/packages/rx_notifier)
- [flutter_modular](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular)

Flutter Modular was used as a guide just to understand how the dependency injection would behave in this case.

In the future the idea is to create an example using the GetIt package, so I can compare the boilerplate each package adds to the project.


## More informations
Here are some links to help you understand more about the concept of Atomic States and how it would be beneficial to the project.
